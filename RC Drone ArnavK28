# Building an RC Drone

## Summary

I am going to build an RC Drone because I'm fascinated by drone technology and its innumerable applications. Since this is my first drone project, my drone will be pretty basic and will not perform functions other than flying. Eventually, I plan to have attach a camera so that my quadcopter can be used for filming or photography purposes. I'm really excited to make it because I've been wanting to make this since a really long time. 

## Plan

First, I will assemble the drone's frame and solder the ESC's. Then, I will attach the propellers and motors. I will then program the arduino uno and connect the batteries and accelerometer. Finally, my drone will be ready to fly.
I've watched a lot of videos to be able to make my quadcopter, here are a couple of them:
