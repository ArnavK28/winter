# Building an RC Drone

## Summary

I am going to build an RC Drone because I have built RC cars in the past but a drone is something I have always been wanting to built. I'm buying a kit as it includes most of the parts that i require to build a drone. If I buy each of the parts separately, ordering each of them will consume a lot of time. I will purchase the charger and batteries separately. 

## Plan

First, I will assemble the drone's frame and then attach the propellers and motors. I'll then code, attach the batteries and remaining components such as vibration absorbers, radio systems, etc.
Videos I've watched to help me make it:
